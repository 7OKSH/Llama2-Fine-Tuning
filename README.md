# Llama2 Fine-Tuning Project

## Project Overview

This project focuses on fine-tuning the Llama2 language model using the Hugging Face Transformers library. The goal is to customize the pre-trained Llama2 model for specific tasks, enhancing its performance by training it on task-specific data. This project includes loading the base model, applying performance-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques, merging adapters, and pushing the fine-tuned model and tokenizer to the Hugging Face Hub for easy sharing and deployment.

## Key Features

- **Loading Pre-trained Model**: The project starts by loading the base Llama2 model using `AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained`.
- **Performance-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)**: Incorporates PEFT by loading and applying adapter models to the base model.
- **Merging and Unloading Adapters**: Merges the adapters with the base model for optimized performance.
- **Pushing to Hugging Face Hub**: Uploads the fine-tuned model and tokenizer to the Hugging Face Hub for public access and use.
